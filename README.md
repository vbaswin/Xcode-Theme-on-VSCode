# xcode-default-light 

The default Light theme in Xcode is something. Not being able to find Such nice theme,
I replicated most of it to suit basic programming.
Hope it helps to other programmers who also like Xcode light theme.

Will soon be adding the dark theme as well !

Open to contributions 😁
