# xcode-default-light 

The default Light theme in Xcode is something. Not being able to find Such nice theme,
I replicated most of it to suit basic programming.
Hope it helps to other programmers who also like Xcode light theme.

Working on Dark theme.
Will soon be adding the it as well 😄

Open to contributions 😁
